In this case study, we will explore a database scenario for a fictional company called "TechMart," which sells various electronic products. We'll present a series of SQL challenges, ranging from medium to advanced difficulty levels, that require us to use our SQL skills to extract, manipulate, and analyze data from the TechMart database. 

## Note

3) Write a SQL query that shows the order_id, order_date, product_id, product_name, and quantity for each product purchased by a specific customer with customer_id = 5001.
4) Write a SQL query to calculate the total revenue generated by each product category, considering the unit price and quantity sold for each product. The result should display the category_id, category_name, and total revenue.
